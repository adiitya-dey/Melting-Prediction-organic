    "SMILES denotes a molecular structure as a graph with optional chiral indications. This is essentially the two-dimensional picture chemists draw to describe a molecule. SMILES describing only the labeled molecular graph (i.e. atoms and bonds, but no chiral or isotopic information) are known as generic SMILES. There are usually a large number of valid generic SMILES which represent a given structure. A canonicalization algorithm exists to generate one special generic SMILES among all valid possibilities; this special one is known as the \"unique SMILES\". SMILES written with isotopic and chiral specifications are collectively known as \"isomeric SMILES\". A unique isomeric SMILES is known as an \"absolute SMILES\". See the following examples.\n",
